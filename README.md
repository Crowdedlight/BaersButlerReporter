# BaersButlerReporter

Reporter is put together by utilizing BraveReporters core functions.
It's ported to an WPF app and simplified alot with way fewer functions/options atm. More will come if needed. 

Original BraveReporter was made by Serinus Gareth. Check it out at https://github.com/Serinus1/BraveReporter
